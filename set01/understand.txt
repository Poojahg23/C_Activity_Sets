string is an array of characters terminated by \0.
# how to compute two strings
starts with for loop
compare  ith  character in x with ith character in y
if  and else statement (dont return 0)
else i++
&& prevents going beyond 0(&&x[i]!='\0'&&y[i])

start loop with i=0
stop loop when a[i]=='\0'

{
    int count=0;
    for(int i=0;a[i]!='\0';i++)
    if(a[i]=='a')
    count++;
}
